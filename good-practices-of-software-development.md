# Good Practices for Software Development
## List of points which are new to me
1. Use the group chat/channels to communicate most of the time. This is preferable over private DMs simply because there are more eyes on the main channel.
2. Use Github gists to share code snippets. Use sandbox environments like Codepen, Codesandbox to share the entire setup
3. Look at the way issues get reported in large open-source projects.
4. Work when you work, play when you play is a good thumb rule.
5. Tracking time using app like Boosted to improve productivity.
## Area where I need to improve on 
The area where I need to improve is Gathering Requirements, sometimes i get so involved in conversation that I forget to make notes of the important points and sometimes hesitate to ask questions.
### Steps to be taken to improve in Gathering requirements
1. I will use notes to make points wherever possible to get used to making notes.
2. Whenever I learn new things, I will make notes of important topics or important points.
3. I will ask questions to clear my doubts or to get confirmation about what I understood.
