## Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg - Core Message
### How to use B = MAP to make new habits easier
**Steps to be followed to make new habits easier are:**
1. Shrink the new behavior to its tiniest version.
2. Identify an Action Prompt to trigger tiny habit.

In B=MAP, M stands for Motivation, A stands for Ability and P stands for Prompt.

It is important to Celebrate after each successful completion of habit because it gives motivation to learn more new habits. By celebrating, confidence to learn new habits increases.
