# Grit and Growth Mindset
## Grit
Each individual must have a long-term goal in life. Our long-term goal should be related to something we are passionate about. In order to fulfill that goal, we need to work hard sincerely and never compromise on it. Whenever we make mistakes, we need to learn from them and strive to improve. When we encounter obstacles on the path to achieving our long-term goal, we should never give up. Instead, we should work to overcome those obstacles.
## Introduction to Growth Mindset
Each individual must have a Growth Mindset rather than a Fixed Mindset. If an individual has a Growth Mindset, they will strive to improve their skills and stay updated with emerging technologies. People with a Growth Mindset believe in continuous learning to enhance their abilities. They also believe that anyone can learn new things through consistent effort and learning. Individuals with a Growth Mindset are always eager to become the best versions of themselves and view mistakes as opportunities for learning.
## Understanding Internal Locus of Control
An Internal Locus of Control is the belief that a person's actions and their consequences are within their own control. People with an Internal Locus of Control believe that whatever they achieve is due to their hardwork and dedication. They consistently trust in the value of hardwork and are always ready to put in the effort to accomplish their goals. Hard work is a quality that we can control.
